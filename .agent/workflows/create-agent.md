# /create-agent

**Senior Agent Architect Activation Protocol**

## Task
Invoke the **Senior Agent Architect** to design and implement a new HIGH-FIDELITY agent.

## Interactive Workflow

This is not a simple file generator. It is a design session.

1.  **Start:** Architect receives the `/create-agent` command.
2.  **Socratic Interrogation (Definition Phase):**
    *   The Architect **MUST** ask 3 strategic questions before creating anything:
    *   1. *Identity:* "What is the personality of this agent? (Mentor, Critic, Executor?)"
    *   2. *Boundaries:* "What must this agent strictly NOT do?"
    *   3. *Triggers:* "What technical keywords ensure only it answers the call?"
3.  **Draft:** Architect proposes the structure (Name, Description, Skills).
4.  **Creation:** After approval, Architect generates the files.
5.  **Registration:** Architect updates `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Interactive Prompt

```
/create-agent [name] [domain]
```

**Example:**
`/create-agent security-auditor "Smart contract auditing"`

*Expected Architect Response:*
"Understood. To create an elite Security Auditor, I need to define:
1. Should it be a 'Red Teamer' (aggressive) or 'Compliance Checker' (methodical)?
2. Can it execute exploit scripts or only read code?..."

## 🧪 Post-Creation Verification
After creation, the Architect should simulate a test prompt to verify if the new agent "wakes up" correctly and if it refuses tasks out of its scope.
